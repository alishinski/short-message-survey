# Short Message Survey

*Short Message Survey* is an app for sending out text-based ESM surveys.

## To-do in the immediate term

- Create a minimal viable product locally
- Taking the local instance and figuring out how to deploy it (via some cloud service; possibly AWS)

## Functionality

### Necessary functionality

- Send messages at random intervals within some parameters
  - Parameters: which days, which hours
  - In general, and in just one case, something like 3-5 messages per day per person for two weeks
- Be able to take between roughly 5-1,000 phone numbers and to send messages on a (semi-random) schedule
- Has to be more-or-less instantaneous 
- Store the data we receive
- Prioritize data privacy/confidentiality and the safety of storing the data
- Allow natural text (i.e., "I'm at the library studying with friends") as well as more closed-form types of answers (i.e., A-E or 1-5)
- Includes tests

### Desired functionality

- Doing some kind of validation of responses
- Making a python library available to others (free and open-source)

### Other ideas

- Be able to allow users to nominate to share their location
- Be able to take audio/photos
- Making an R package available to others (free and open-source)
- Having a web interface (for $ and open-source)
- Having the functionality to do some kind of intervention via a chat bot
